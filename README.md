# SI: Parameter estimation on multivalent ITC datasets

## About 
This ist the source code of the algorithm used for the paper. 
The code is written in python 3.7. ITC datasets, saved as EXCEL tables, are extracted and fitted by 
the common Wiseman algorithm and the proposed Qc fitting. 
## Data
For the bivalent ITC dataset, see "Man1010Lacetate2.xlsx". For thee trivalent ITC dataset, see "Man1355LLBB25.xlsx"
## Saves
Here, the parameters are stored, which were used in the paper. 
Each parameter is stored in a separate file and kann be imported through numpy.
## Src
Contains the source code. Use "main.py" to run the code.
